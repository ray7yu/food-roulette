### About

Bored of the same old recipes? Try the Food Roulette! Using the Recipe Search API 
from [Edamam.com](https://www.edamam.com), you can specify specific aspects of the recipe you want, 
including health restrictions, cooking time, and diet type. 
Each result includes information such as a list of ingredients, dietary cautions, 
a link to the original recipe, etc. Try it out!

### Tools

React, HTML/CSS, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose were used to develop this app. MongoDB Atlas hosts the database used to hold user information.
